<article id="tribute-info">
<ul>
  <li style="padding:10px;"><b>1914</b> - Born in Cresco, Iowa </li>
  <li style="padding:10px;"><b>1933</b> - Leaves his family's farm to attend the University of Minnesota, thanks<br> to a Depression era program known as the "National Youth Administration" </li>
  <li style="padding:10px;"><b>1935</b> - Has to stop school and save up more money. Works in the Civilian<br> Conservation Corps, helping starving Americans. "I saw how food changed<br> them", he said. "All of this left scars on me."</li>
  <li style="padding:10px;"><b>1937</b> - Finishes university and takes a job in the US Forestry Service </li>
  <li style="padding:10px;"><b>1938</b> - Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson. Gets laid off due to budget<br> cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman, he returns to school study under<br> Stakman, who teaches him about breeding pest-resistent plants. </li>
  <li style="padding:10px;"><b>1941</b> - Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl Harbor attack, but is<br> rejected. Instead, the military asked his lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT<br> to control malaria, disinfectants, and other applied science. </li>
  <li style="padding:10px;"><b>1942</b> - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology</li>
  <li style="padding:10px;"><b>1944</b> - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves behind his<br> pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to head a new plant pathology program.<br> Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000 different strains of disease<br> resistent wheat - including different varieties for each major climate on Earth. </li>
  <li style="padding:10px;"><b>1945</b> - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season, doubling<br> wheat yields</li>
  <li style="padding:10px;"><b>1953</b> - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yeidling<br> American breed, creating a strain that responds well to fertilizer. It goes on to<br> provide 95% of Mexico's wheat. </li>
  <li style="padding:10px;"><b>1962</b> - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of wheat to the Indian<br> subcontinent in time to help mitigate mass starvation due to a rapidly<br> expanding population </li>
  <li style="padding:10px;"><b>1970</b> - receives the Nobel Peace Prize</li>
  <li style="padding:10px;"><b>1983</b> - helps seven African countries dramatically increase their maize and<br> sorghum yields</li>
  <li style="padding:10px;"><b>1984</b> - becomes a distinguished professor at Texas A&M University</li>
  <li style="padding:10px;"><b>2005</b> - states "we will have to double the world food supply by 2050." Argues<br> that genetically modified crops are the only way we can meet the demand, as<br> we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops are not inherently dangerous<br> because "we've been genetically modifying plants and animals for a long<br> time. Long before we called it science, people were selecting the best breeds."</li>
  <li style="padding:10px;"><b>2009</b> - dies at the age of 95</li>
